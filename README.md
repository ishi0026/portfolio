Questions?
should use other frameworks??? tailwind?
should use media query for responsive? only used with bootstrap...
color custom properties - contact page button is ok, will add works page or not? can I change text-danger color? or should add specific name? 
image optimize using "picture"
validate html, css -  contactForm for attribute role in form /  socialmedia for attribute role on element footer in fotter??? 
if possible, card links - hope not make it blue and undelined  → bad effect for social media link, so deleted once
if possible, icon and favicon make rounded
if possible, description pop up when card touched

card animation delete in specific one →　change class name to avoid move top page's cards
→ card size optimize in each png?(animate showed difference)
