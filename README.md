Questions?
1.add contents(paragraphs)
★should use other frameworks??? tailwind? js? yes- trying to use animation css or something
should use media query for responsive? only used with bootstrap...

if possible, card links - hope not make it blue and undelined  → bad effect for social media link, so deleted once
if possible, icon and favicon make rounded
if possible, description pop up when card touched

make button for pdf? or, delete button?

accecibility aria add -almost done / just make sure at last- role, placeholder etc
image optimize using "picture" - almost done / just make sure does need --w or not 

card animation delete in specific one →　change class name to avoid move top page's cards
→ card size optimize in each png?(animate showed difference)  → ok? animation not required in rubrics

delete the color around "works" -ok add bg-light
space on "works" ok - delete py-5 it used for y axis
navigation bar right ok -justify content-end, contents right (remove spaces) ok - class="bg-light container-md mb-5"
The size of the icons ok
skiplinks work ok
the size of the box ok - change rem, 
works-delete line around box ok-border-light
index delete line around box ok- div class="card h-100 border-light"
change SNS icon size ok -in css Svg section
submit button center -ok  created div class and set col / mx-auto d-block also work

submit button animation - ok added  .col button {} in css

footer &copy right bottom side - only tried in contact page -ok  added .row{ text-align: left;} in css, and change the div<> to bottom of the sns links

fonts - it works by setting each h1-h5 tags ok

★2.color custom properties - contact page button is ok, will add works page or not? can I change text-danger color? or should add specific name? 　
→ we can change the default color name using bs-primary:#xxxx in css file

★3.validate html, css -  in html, contactForm for attribute role in form →　I can only use some words in ARIA /  ok(deleted footer roles):socialmedia for attribute role on element footer in footer error??? → ARIA roles can only use specific words. such as region. so we can't create original names for them.
